# Kepler
This is my play ground to do and learn dx12.

#Simple Lighting App
Simple point light and ray tracing. I try not to use wrappers provided by microsoft samples. In my experience they caused me more confusion while learning. So I have kept the application as much verbose as possible. Though the source becomes huge but if you just step through you can understand what is happening without jumping around wrappers back and forth.
